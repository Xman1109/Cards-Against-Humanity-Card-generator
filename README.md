I have made this little script in less than 3 hours, so it's not perfect, but it works. If you encounter any bugs, please report them to me or fix them yourself if you have the knowledge.

**Install**:
1. Install Python 3 if you haven't already
2. Open Command Prompt inside this folder
3. Type in ````pip install -r requirements.txt````

**Usage**:
1. Open the input.json file in a text editor (Notepad works too)
2. Input your fancy question and answer cards
3. execute the generator.py file
4. Print the .png files from the /card-sets directory
5. Cut the cards and laminate them (or just print them in a copyshop so the paper is thick enough)



**Note**: You can create your own card backgrounds, visit ````/src/Custom_Packs/How to create your own pack.txt````
